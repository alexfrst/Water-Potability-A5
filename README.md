This repos contains our work on the water-potability dataset assesment.

The most relevant notebooks are stored in repo's root, those are **DataAnalysis.inpyb** and **Models.ipynb**. 

In order to produce dataviz we've used plotly, it give good looking graphs but it makes notebooks really heavy. In the case youe IDE doesn't support big notebooks we've exported them in HTML files. Do not hesitate to hover graphs and move around those are interactive.

We've kept our draft files in the `\legacy` folder.
